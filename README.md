# candles

This is just a simple Forge mod to add various candles into Minecraft 1.16.1.

## Compiling
(apparently I'm supposed to have this here???)
You need the [Java Development Kit](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html) to compile candles.
It is compiled using gradle but apparently you don't need to download that.

### Windows
To compile the mod, shift + right click on the folder with candles' files and click
"open command prompt" and type the command `gradlew build`.

### Mac/Linux
lol use windows
